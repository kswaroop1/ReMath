# AI assistance record — PR #23 content-pack lifecycle

## 2026-10-08 — Scope recovery and acceptance contract

The automation verified that PR #22 merged into `main` at commit `a53344e` and
that no pull request remained open. It recovered `AGENTS.md`, the feature
register, roadmap, content-pack documentation, existing parser/validator code,
and the accepted sequence naming content-pack lifecycle as PR #23.

The assistant bounded the slice to CP-002, CP-004, CP-006, CP-008, CP-010,
CP-011, CP-012, and CP-013. Digest and publisher-signature verification belong
to the activation boundary, but publisher onboarding, trust-root distribution,
key rotation/revocation, network catalogues, OAuth, delta updates, release work,
credentials, and `VERSION` changes remain excluded. This contract is committed
before the first test-only commit as required by `AGENTS.md`.
