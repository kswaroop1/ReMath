## Assistant — selection

The repository and prior agreed infrastructure sequence were reconciled after
PR21 merged. PR22 is the portable backup/recovery slice, followed by content-pack
lifecycle and operational security. The accepted working rules continue:
test-first red/green commits, meaningful coverage near 100%, chronological AI
provenance, green CI, explicit independent `@codex review`, and correction of
review findings before handoff. Merge control remains with the user.

Selected DS-004, DS-016, DS-017, SP-005 and SP-012 foundations. The slice uses
encrypted versioned export, read-only preview, transactional idempotent event
merge and a provider-neutral file boundary. It excludes cloud sync, OAuth,
content-pack transfer, release and VERSION changes.
